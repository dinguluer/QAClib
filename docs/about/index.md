# Why to use QML not C++
If you want to work on the presentation layer then you want to do something amazing not just about creating buttons,
suppose you want to do suppose you want to do 3D rendering & show animation or inline movement QML will solve all those Problems.

But if you will do it with C plus plus you will be importing libraries, you will be interfacing with classes, you will have a lot of bugs interfacing problems, compiling errors, runtime errors, floating point processing problem, hung pointers, broke memory loss etc. And all this problems which will make your life difficult. QML take care of all that.

QML application allows integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++. The Qt QML module provides both a QML API and a C++ API.
